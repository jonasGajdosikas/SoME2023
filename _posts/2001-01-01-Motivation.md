## Personal story time

When I was in high school, I got interested in TTRPGs (GURPS if anyone is interested). I quite liked playing around with dice, and with the most common roll being the [3d6](../../../glossary.html#ndk) I got quite interested in how the probabilities for each roll are calculated.
I knew that somehow one vould calculate the odds for each possible result - [people had done so already](https://anydice.com); but I was wondering if it was possible to find an explicit formula for each value.
